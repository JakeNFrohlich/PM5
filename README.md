# Dynamic Task Scheduler

Team members: Jake Frohlich, Vrishank Bangari, Ethan, Neha Bangari

Our project, the Dynamic Task Scheduler, is a task schedule automation tool for software engineers. The proposed solution uses algorithms to delegate tasks automatically throughout the week, considering factors such as task priority, individual skill sets, and current workloads. By automating the task allocation process, the scheduler aims to optimize resource utilization and increase team productivity.
